I have an UHF RFID scanner - RFID LABElS

I want to use the labels on the product and scan them with the scanner directly into an SQL database, 
this database requires a website to display the stock values.

UHF RFID scanner connects to device via USB - acts like keyboard and prints label data directly. Requires RAW INPUT? 

Where do i start? Any help appreciated
