# Perishable Inventory Management System Online - Big Kitchens e.g TakeAways/Hotels/Schools

Creation of a real-time perishable inventory managmentsystem online 'Pimso', Systems components have been aquired and implemented. Now looking for assitance on developing further whilst in infancy.

Requirements list: 

1. Database
2. Website
3. RFID API

Current status of requirements:

1. Database designed, built and tested
2. Website hosting purchased, basic website implementation
3. RFID equiptment bought, basic SDK file to link to database <- Development required. 

Main focus:

Creating an API that can be run on a desktop computer, taking data from RFID Antennas and inputting that into the database. 

Questions: 

Can an API be created that accesses the RFID antennas via RS232/USB? In otherwords, If equiptment is setup in a franchised takeaway, can this be directrly accessed via the mainframe/firewall (similar to PDQ's/EPOS), or will this have to be run on a desktop computer that could potentially be turned off by an employee etc.

I have an UHF RFID scanner - RFID LABElS

I want to use the labels on the product and scan them with the scanner directly into an SQL database, 
this database requires a website to display the stock values.

UHF RFID scanner connects to device via USB - acts like keyboard and prints label data directly. Requires RAW INPUT? 

Where do i start? Any help appreciated
